                        "description": "<p>Collecting more than 500 pages of the influential Italian cartoonist&rsquo;s most famous adaptations of the erotic literary canon in a beautiful slipcased box set.In Vol. 7, &ldquo;Story of a Story&rdquo; (1981) stars Milanese photographer Valentina. Finding herself home alone, she cheekily decides to fantasize about Georges Bataille&rsquo;s infamous novella The Story of the Eye &mdash; with a twist: she&rsquo;s playing all the roles! In the stories &ldquo;Emmanuelle&rdquo; (1978) and &ldquo;Emmanuelle: The Anti-Virgin&rdquo; (1990), Crepax follows the titular heroine on her sensual journey as the polyamorous wife of a French diplomat in Thailand. While the character is best known as the star of a series of pornographic movies, most notably the 1974 film starring Sylvia Kristel, she originated in a banned 1959 novel by Marayat Rollet-Andriane (pen name Emmanuelle Arsan), a Thai French woman. Emmanuelle has a sexual encounter on a plane, plays a steamy game of squash with a countess, falls for a woman named Bee, and has an intense experience at a temple, among the many other transgressive exploits Crepax details from the novel. And, in an innovation of Crepax&rsquo;s own &mdash; she crosses paths with King Kong!Vol. 8 contains Crepax&rsquo;s longest graphic novel &mdash; &ldquo;Story of O.&rdquo; A woman finds fulfillment when she subsumes her identity by sexually submitting to a secret society. Crepax sumptuously draws every strike of the whip and taps into the sensuality of body modification in his adaptation of this groundbreaking work. Also included is his short story &ldquo;The Unexpected Exchange,&rdquo; filled with the sensual delights you have come to expect from Crepax: lingerie, bisexuality, the 1920s, and the most symbolically drawn train you&rsquo;ve ever seen outside of a Hitchcock film. In addition to the usual accompanying essays putting Crepax&rsquo;s stories into historical and cultural context, this volume also features Nouveau Roman novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet&rsquo;s (The Voyeur, Last Year at Marienbad) introduction to Story of O.</p>",

Other groups\nfollowed, such as X__X (pronounced ex-blank-ex), who shared similarities with Downtown New\nYork’s No Wave movement, which was happening concurrently.\nAfter the dissolution of X__X in the late 70s, Morton left Cleveland and moved to New York,\nwhere he shifted his focus to visual art, and occupied a burgeoning scene populated with figures\nsuch as Basquiat and Keith Haring. This book features examples of Morton’s artworks, from this\nfebrile period up to the present, alongside his lesser known and more recent forays into poetry—\nspecifically, experiments in the formats of haiku and tanka. Collected together for the first time,\nthis selection of works delves into Morton’s preoccupations and obsessions: junk culture like B-\nmovies and robots, memories of musician friends such as Anton Fier and Peter Laughner, or\neven more serious matters surrounding mental health, addiction, and death.\n“Morton describes himself as a Nihilist— ‘a sociopath that has taken a course in philosophy,’ he\njokes— and he has the learning and the life to back this up.”\n\n--Jon Savage, author of England’s Dreaming",

From the discovery of fire to organic cooking, this book is aimed at all curious people and foodies. By the author of&nbsp;Wine, A Graphic History. As soon as humans mastered fire, they invented cooking. Did you know that Sapiens invented steam cooking and freezing? That the Mesopotamians created soups, bread, beer, ovens? That gastronomy and tableware have been symbols of political power? These great discoveries changed the world, but also the way we eat. From America, the conquistadors brought spices, peppers, potatoes... Portuguese missionaries brought the frying technique to distant samurai who made the first tempuras. These are the beginnings of globalization. In the 19th century with the industrial revolution, &ldquo;capitalist&rdquo; cuisine emerged: it was the beginning of the food industry. In the 21st century, the organic and buy local movements are shown as a reaction against the harmful effects of this culinary and gastronomic standardization. To finish in style, find twenty-two recipes for dishes mentioned throughout our story that you can make at home!</p>",

The stage is set for 32 skin-crawling poems imagining various children&rsquo;s nightmares, all with sequential illustrations by Danish horror master Mortensen.His eerie visions fade to black at the edges, like a dreamer unable to shift their focus, and inspire delicious terror all by themselves. Similarly, the short poems each evoke a distinct sense of dread for the sleeping imagination to expand upon; together, the words and pictures conjure a nightmarish world tinged with pitch black humor. The sequences splay across double-page spreads, evoking Edward Gorey gone grand scale, and grand guignol.For those of a nervous disposition, read in bright sunlight. For those in search of a nervous disposition, take two before bed.</p>",

But those in Gotham's underworld know that beneath the dapper attire and gentlemanly demeanor lies a calculating and ruthless criminal who isn't afraid to take whatever he thinks he deserves. And should you happen to be in the way of something he wants, know that this bird is just as deadly as any other raptor. Discover the man behind the new Max streaming series in this special issue showcasing the Penguin's 1941 debut in the pages of Detective Comics #58, twisted recollections of his formative years from Secret Origins Special #1 and Joker's Asylum: Penguin #1, and a brand-new, exclusive story written by Jeremy Adams and illustrated by Howard Porter that shows the Penguin's next moves during All In.</p>",

                        "description": "Author and illustrator Aaron Lange (AIN’T IT FUN: PETER LAUGHNER AND PROTO-PUNK IN THE SECRET CITY) plumbs the depths of the subconscious with PEPPERMINT WEREWOLF: MURKSTAVE, and in the process catalogues myriad perversions from antiquity to the internet age and beyond. Relentlessly obsessive and radically experimental, this avant-garde work of comic art includes an erotic visual inventory of the Germanic runes; the secret language of fetishism; and sacred geometry as it relates to the mysteries of Sarah Michelle Gellar’s nose. A maelstrom of semiotics, PEPPERMINT WEREWOLF: MURKSTAVE has all this and more. For fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, neo-decadence, pin-up art, black metal, occultism, industrial culture, and Norse mythology. There's literally nothing in these pages that is anything less than fully formed, deliberate, and razor-sharp— Daniel Clowes may have titled one of his better works LIKE A VELVET GLOVE CAST IN IRON, but Lange LIVES those words, carving imagery onto the page with the precision of a scalpel and the grace of a quill. There's an undercurrent of danger, desperation, and depravity to these proceedings even at their most breathtaking and sublime that makes you feel as if no less than William Blake or Austin Osman Spare would approve of what was happening if they were around to witness it. PEPPERMINT WEREWOLF is a key that unlocks a door, and what that door opens onto and into will no doubt be unique to each reader. -Ryan C's Four-Color Apocalypse",

Her latest mission: to restore life to the wetlands that Gotham City's industrial waste has destroyed. But her goals are upended when she unintentionally resurrects an ancient place from Gotham's past and with it...something hungry. Meanwhile, cleansing fires burn across America, seeking to rid the country of human influence. And somehow, Poison Ivy is to blame. Join the GLAAD Media Award-winning team of G. Willow Wilson and Marcio Takara for the third year of their beautiful, bleak, and blistering series. You won't want to miss out.",

Part advice column and exhibit, exploration of psychic pollution and tranquility, Processing is&mdash;quite simply&mdash;intrepid: in its honesty; its unapologetic grossness; its unrivaled and frank portrayal of life with a body that bleeds. In the grand tradition of underground women cartoonists like Julie Doucet and Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Booth draws a horned up woman laying rose petals on the bed, to distract from the bedbugs before her hookup arrives. She bears witness to the reality of wearing a t-shirt with no bra&mdash;when you stretch, your boobs, sometimes, pop right out. This is all just life but we don&rsquo;t often see it on the page. Undaunted, Booth draws it. When advice from spiritual gurus like Tara Brach and Ram Dass just aren&rsquo;t cutting it, take solace in the genuine arms of Tara Booth: a fearless cartoonist who is unafraid to put her existential angst, blemishes, and stains right on the page, and who&mdash;with relentless relatability&mdash;makes us all feel a bit more at home in our too-human vessels. With color that vibrates and fluids that impose, Processing lays Booth bare&mdash;literally and figuratively.</p>",

Not that the ritzier spots on the Strip haven't come calling, of course. But since a devastating instance of magic gone wrong that forever changed the course of her childhood, Zatanna would much rather live out her days as a top-hat-and-fishnets-wearing sleight-of-hand stage act than bother with real magic. These days, she doesn't think much of the past at all. That is, until an interdimensional vortex cracks open during Zatanna's act, and a terrifying demon crawls out to kill her. If she hopes to survive the horrors that follow it, she'll need to take herself and her power seriously for the first time in a long time - and fast. Because when it comes to your past, you can run... but you can't hide forever! CGC GRADED 9.6 OR HIGHER!

Children recount what they saw-some describe a beast, others a dragon, some even mention an elf-but is there truly something sinister at work, or have their imaginations gotten the best of them? While King Harrow, Aunt Amaya, and the rest of the adults attempt to solve the mystery, Callum and Ezran meet compelling forces of their own. While each prince has something to prove, they will need to work together if they want to get to the bottom of things. Can Callum and Ezran uncover the source of the chaos before all of Noct is lost to a nightmare?",

With a meld of history, fantasy, and memoir, Side Quest: A Visual History of Roleplaying Games gives existing fans of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) insight into the history of the medium-and provides a gateway for anyone new to the phenomenon. The creators, Steenz and Samuel Sattin, narrate the book, switching between personal stories about their RPG experiences and concrete information that reveals the fascinating and often little-known history of these games. (Did you know that H. G. Wells created an RPG in the early 1900s? You will soon, along with so much more!) This book is geared toward an audience of gamers, non-gamers, and general readers alike.",

Throughout her life, she never sold a piece-she gave art to family and friends, and shared her work online, but never received wider recognition for her work. This graphic novel by her son, Tim Bird, explores their family life and her creative explorations through a mix of her paintings and Tim's comics, depicting their relationship and her life from teenagehood to her struggle with cancer at the height of the COVID pandemic.

Did you know that Sapiens invented steam cooking and freezing? That the Mesopotamians created soups, bread, beer, ovens? That gastronomy and tableware have been symbols of political power? These great discoveries changed the world, but also the way we eat. From America, the conquistadors brought spices, peppers, potatoes... Portuguese missionaries brought the frying technique to distant samurai who made the first tempuras. These are the beginnings of globalization. In the 19th century with the industrial revolution, \"capitalist\" cuisine emerged: it was the beginning of the food industry. In the 21st century, the organic and buy local movements are shown as a reaction against the harmful effects of this culinary and gastronomic standardization. To finish in style, find twenty-two recipes for dishes mentioned throughout our story that you can make at home!",

Collecting the work of Ian Edginton and Tiernen Trevallion, the second omnibus of Fiends of the Eastern Front follows Constanta's bloody trail across history, and brings monstrous terror from the skies of wartime France to the streets of 1960s London.",
